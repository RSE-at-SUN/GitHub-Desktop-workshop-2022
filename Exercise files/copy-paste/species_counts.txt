## The aim of this script is to produce a table of species observation counts, and a bar plot
## showing the species counts for the most diverse genera in the survey



# Load libraries (make sure they are installed first!)

if (!('tidyverse' %in% row.names(installed.packages()))) install.packages('tidyverse', dependencies = TRUE)

# Get the data (or load into R directly from the web)

# The following dataset was suggested in the following Data Carpentry lesson: https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/02-starting-with-data.html

#surveys <- read_csv("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169") # to access dataset from online source

surveys <- read_csv("data/survey_sample.csv") # to load dataset that is already downloaded



# Have a look at the structure of the data

str(surveys)



# Count number of observations of each species

# In the species present, count representative species of each genus

# Identify top 3 most diverse genera

# Get counts of species in the 3 most-diverse genera

# Save the table to file
